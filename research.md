1. Title - “Adulting” field study

2. Authors and stakeholders
    - Dave Parker, application author
    - Drew Mahrt, Charles Drews, instructors/evaluators

3. Date - 5/12/17

4. Background:

    Personally, I know that I’m always losing track of when I bought what groceries, when they go bad, and what staples I’m running low on. Preliminary, casual research suggests that people also worry about similar issues of time, such as forgetting about recurring bill, and keeping track of their emotions over time

5. Goals - I want to systematically establish the viability of and general interest in a tracking app with this particular bent..

6. Research questions:
    1. How much effort do people put into keeping track of these kind of “adulting” pieces of information over time.
    1. Do people find that they are presently and actively losing out by their failure to keep track of this kind of data.
    1. How much would they benefit, both in terms of reducing overhead and increasing compliance.
    1. What pieces of information do people need?
    1. Value of notifications vs actively opening the app themselves.
    

7. Methodology - Google Forms survey with additional one-on-one online/text interviews on any points requiring clarification.

8. Participants - Primarily 20s and early 30s, active professionals.

9. Schedule - Recruiting: 5/9, interviews: 5/10-5/11, results 5/12.

10. Script:
    1. How much food do you throw out due to it being over-old?
    1. When it comes to obligations outside of the professional sphere (ie ”adulting”), what are three other components you find most difficult?
    1. How much time/effort is spent on meeting these obligations?
    1. How much time/effort/money is spent or lost because of missed obligations?
    1. How valuable would it be to have informations/reminders about these obligations presented to you on a timely basis? Active presentation or available when you want it?
